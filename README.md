Playful HK style Cha_Chaan_Teng order menu

**Be aware there is some local Cantonese slang that is a bit impolite, but how ever it is the real HK Style of making an order in Cha Chaan Teng by waiters**

It is a python program where
- Showed Cha Chaan Teng Menu

- Price of the meal

2: Using Flask library to make a WebGUI with images

Enjoy!
